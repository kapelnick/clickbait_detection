#Typically, 5 to 10 questions per article are reasonable. This range allows you to assess different aspects of click-bait content without overwhelming the raters with too many questions.

#A common approach is to have each article rated by multiple raters (e.g., 3 to 5 raters). This allows you to calculate inter-rater agreement to assess the consistency of ratings among different raters.

#Having a larger pool of raters can also help account for individual biases. Aim for at least 5 to 10 raters if possible.

#Instructions to Raters: Provide clear and detailed instructions to raters, explaining the purpose of the task, the click-bait characteristics to look for, and the rating scale (if applicable). Encourage raters to provide honest and thoughtful evaluations.

#Pilot Testing: Before launching the full rating process, consider conducting a pilot test with a small subset of articles and raters to identify any issues with the rating instructions or questions. This can help refine the rating process before scaling it up.

#Timeframe: Consider the time it will take for raters to review each article and answer the questions. Ensure that the rating process is feasible within the desired timeframe.

#As a general guideline, you could consider having each article rated by 3 to 5 raters, and select a random subset of approximately 20% to 30% of the total articles for rating. This would result in having 3 to 5 raters rate each article in the selected subset.

For example:

If you choose to have 20% of the articles rated: 20% of 1110 = 222 articles
If you have 3 raters per article: Total articles for rating = 222 x 3 = 666 articles
